# videogame_analysis

For this project I have used data about the video game industry from Kaggle (Video Game Sales with Ratings Video game sales from Vgchartz and corresponding ratings from Metacritic by Rush Kirubi https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings), which was gathered from VGCHARTZ (http://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/) and MetaCritic (https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/release-date/available) using BeautifulSoup. I will ask 3 meaningful questions which will help my stakeholder to have a better understanding of the gaming industry.

    Does Nintendo sell better than Xbox in Japan?
    Do action/shooter games sell better than sport games in the USA?
    Do users and critics give similar scores to PlayStation games?
